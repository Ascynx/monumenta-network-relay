# Monumenta Network Relay

This is a library plugin for Minecraft/Bukkit/Spigot/Paper that relays messages
between servers using RabbitMQ. This is a replacement for plugin messaging
channels or sockets, which both have significant limitations.

It was originally developed for [Monumenta](https://www.playmonumenta.com/), a
free community developed Complete-The-Monument MMORPG Minecraft server.

## Licensing

You may also distribute this plugin in binary/compiled format (i.e. .jar) so
long as it retains the MonumentaNetworkRelay name.

For the example plugin under the network-chat-example folder, this code is
